# Text to speech
A text box designed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to convert text/numbers to speech. I utilized one of [my previous projects](https://github.com/chiragobhan/search-bar-ui) for the UI. The code is built on JavaScript's SpeechSynthesisUtterance API and is compatible with 'Screencast' or 'Chromecast'.
